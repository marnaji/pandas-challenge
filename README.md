# pandas-challenge
porpose is to create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

### Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Created a report that includes the data related to each category such as:
 ## District Summary:
    1. Total number of unique schools
    2. Total students
    3. Total budget
    4. Average math score
    5. Average reading score
    6. % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    7. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    8. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

 ## School Summary:
    1. School name
    2. School type
    3. Total students
    4. Total school budget
    5. Per student budget
    6. Average math score
    7. Average reading score
    8. % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    9. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    10. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
 ## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing):
    1.  Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows
    2. Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools"
 ## Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing):
    1. Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
    2. Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".
 ## Math Scores by Grade:
    1. Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
 ## Reading Scores by Grade:
    1. Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
 ## Scores by School Spending:
    1. Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).:
        used Bining and pd.cut to categorize spending based on the bins
    2. Create a DataFrame called spending_summary Include the following metrics in the table: Average math score, Average reading score, % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
 ## Scores by School Size
    1. Use pd.cut on the "Total Students" column of the per_school_summary DataFrame.
    2. Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

 ## Scores by School Type
    1. Use pd.cut on the "Total Students" column of the per_school_summary DataFrame.
    2. Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
